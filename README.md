# TipsGotTrolled
Well,well,well...
iOS 16.0 (including betas) -> 16.1.2. Not higher. 16.2 and more go take a look at kfd (kfd support will be added later)

This uses MacDirtyCow (our beloved), also known as [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530). This vulnerability is also used by Cowabunga and Misaka.
The app replaces your Tips.app with TrollStore Persistance Helper.

We recommend you install the Persistance Helper in an other app after the complete installation of TrollStore.

This keep a copy of your Tips.app binary, so don't worry you will be able to see the nice (useless) tips from this app after installing TrollStore.

This requires a restart. If you currently have MDC based tweaks running, please close them. For better sucess rate, restart before installing the app, and close all your other apps.

What's different with the misaka thing ?
- it's open source, and it has one purpose. if you dont like misaka for whatever reason this could be a great replacement.
- it might work here but not on misaka (not sure of that)

don't run this for now. thanks :)
