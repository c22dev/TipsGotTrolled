# TipsGotTrolled
Well,well,well...


This uses MacDirtyCow (our beloved), also known as [CVE-2022-46689](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT213530). This vulnerability is also used by Cowabunga and Misaka.
The app replaces your Tips.app with TrollStore Persistance Helper.

We recommend you install the Persistance Helper in an other app after the complete installation of TrollStore.

This keep a copy of your Tips.app binary, so don't worry you will be able to see the nice (useless) tips from this app after installing TrollStore.

This requires a restart. If you currently have MDC based tweaks running, please close them. For better sucess rate, restart before installing the app, and close all your other apps.
